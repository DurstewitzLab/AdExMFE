# Analytical Approximation of the Firing Rate of an aEIF Neuron in the Presence of Synaptic Noise

The functions can be used to compute the firing rate of an aEIF neuron as
described in: [Hert√§g, Loreen, Daniel Durstewitz, and Nicolas Brunel. "Analytical approximations
of the firing rate of an adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron in the presence of synaptic
noise." Frontiers in computational neuroscience 8 (2014)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2014.00116/full)
 in the white and colored noise scenario.


Since all programs were implemented for our special scientific purposes, they might not be
eminently suitable for your wishes. Feel free to change the programs according to your needs. In
preperation for release, we deleted some program lines to make it more user-friendly. If we thereby
removed accidently too much and incorporated errors, please report the bug(s) to
loreen.hertaeg@zi-mannheim.de. Thanks for your help and understanding.
